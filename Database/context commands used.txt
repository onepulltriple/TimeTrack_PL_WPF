To use a database-first approach, install the dotnet entity framework tool. 
Open terminal in any directory and enter:
  dotnet tool install --global dotnet-ef

If the tool might already be installed on the computer, use the following command to confirm that it's installed:
  dotnet ef
You should see a unicorn ASCII picture. 


To set up the database context, first install the needed nuget packages:
 - Microsoft.EntityFrameworkCore
 - Microsoft.EntityFrameworkCore.SqlServer
 - Microsoft.EntityFrameworkCore.Tools
 - Microsoft.EntityFrameworkCore.Design
Then restart Visual Studio.


Open terminal and navigate to the project's directory.
Use "dir" to check that you are in the same path as .csproj path. 
One could also right-click on the project (not the solution, the project), e.g. "WPF_APP_NAME", and select "Open in Terminal".

Then run the command:
  dotnet ef dbcontext scaffold "Server=.\SQLEXPRESS; Database=NAME_OF_DATABASE; Integrated Security=True; TrustServerCertificate=True" Microsoft.EntityFrameworkCore.SqlServer --output-dir Entities
The connection string (the part of the command in quotes) may vary.

To overwrite/update the context, use "-f" at the end of this command, e.g. when the database has been changed or expanded.
Save and archive (commit) before updating the database context!
